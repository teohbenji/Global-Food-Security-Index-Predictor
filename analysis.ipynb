    "<!--Background description of the problem-->\n",
    "The global landscape has been significantly impacted by the prolonged effects of a global pandemic, triggering widespread repercussions across various facets of society. One critical area that demands attention is food security, a fundamental pillar of societal stability. As nations navigate the challenges brought forth by the pandemic, understanding and predicting the food security index becomes paramount for effective policymaking and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food security is defined when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.\n",

    "### -----Problem statement------\n",
    "This study endeavors to address the question: \n",
    "How might we create a model to predict the food security of a country during a prolonged global pandemic based on the country's economy, level of development, corruption level, environmental performance, and inflation level?\n",
    "\n",
    "### -----Solution-----\n",
    "The solution to our problem statement lies in the development of a robust predictive model that utilizes advanced data analytics. By incorporating crucial indicators such as a nation's economic parameters, developmental stage, corruption perceptions, environmental performance, and inflation levels, our model not only anticipates potential food security issues but also provides a comprehensive insight into the complex use of influencing factors. This predictive tool empowers timely decision-making, enabling governments and international organizations to proactively distribute resources where they are most needed during a prolonged global pandemic. By furnishing a holistic perspective and supporting data-driven strategies, our model contributes to national resilience and aids in safeguarding food security, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of crises on countries that might be in danger of food security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### -----Initial Model-----\n",
    "In constructing the initial model, we take into account a few combinations of key socio-economic and environmental indicators as such below.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Predicted Variable:  \n",
    "- **Global Food Security Index (GFSI)** is the measure of a country's ability to ensure food security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictor Variables:  \n",
    "- **Human Development Index (HDI)** is a composite index that considers life expectancy, education, and income. Higher HDI values are indicative of better overall development, suggesting that countries with higher human development are likely to have stronger systems in place for ensuring food security.  \n",
    "- **Corruption-perception Index (CI)** measures the perceived level of corruption in a country. A higher value of CI is associated with more transparent governance, efficient resource allocation, and reduced risk of corruption-related challenges that could impact food security.  \n",
    "- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product per Capita)** reflects the average income of a country's citizens. Higher GDP per capita may indicate greater economic prosperity, potentially leading to increased affordability of food and better overall food security.\n",
    "- **EPI (Environmental Performance Index)** assesses a country's environmental performance. A higher EPI score suggests environmentally sustainable practices, which can positively influence food security by promoting agricultural practices that are resilient to environmental changes.\n",
    "- **CPI (Consumer Price Index)** reflects the average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services. Fluctuations in CPI can impact the cost of living and, consequently, the affordability of food. Understanding inflation dynamics is crucial for assessing potential challenges to food security.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we have our initial regression model:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "GFSI = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1HDI + \\beta2CI + \\beta_3GDP + \\beta_4EPI + \\beta_5CPI\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### -----Persona------\n",
    "Dr. Benjamin Teoh, Food Security Analyst who works in United Nations, who has over 10 years of experience in the field of food security and global crisis response. \n",
    "He is tasked with the responsibilities for monitoring the global food security trends for each countries by collaborating with international organisations, governments and NGOs to develop strategies for addressing food security challenges. Dr. Benjamin is an ambitious man who actively seeks innovative solutions to enhance the UN's capacity to respond to crises affecting food security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dr. Benjamin aims to identify countries which are at risk of food security issues well in advance to enable timely intervention and resource mobilization. He also uses tools and accurate data to support his decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the model we create, we can provide Dr. Benjamin with insights into which countries are likely to face heightened food security issues supposedly another global pandemic hits. Since the model incorporates economic, developmental and environmental factors, it will enhance the accuracy of the predictions, aiding Dr. Benjamin in making more informed decisions. Not only that, The model's considerations of multiple variable also aligns with Dr. Benjamin's holistic approach to food security analysis. Finally, the intuitive ease of use of the model ensures that Dr. Benjamin can quickly grasp and utilize the model's findings without extensive technical training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quote by Dr. Benjamin: \"Having a tool that predicts food security issues in advance is a game-changer for our response strategies. I am really grateful to these group of students from SUTD who created this extensively useful model.\"\n",
